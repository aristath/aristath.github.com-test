We all have our addictions. It's part of our human nature...

### I'm a addicted to nicotine:

Yup, unfortunately I'm a smoker.

### I'm addicted to caffeine

I can't help it... I LIKE COFFEE!!!

### I'm probably addicted to painkillers

Ever since I was a teenager I've had migraines.
With my current line of work I'm at least 10 hours/day in front of a monitor which does not help with the whole migraines issue. As a result, I'm almost on a daily basis on painkillers. At this point I'm not sure if the painkillers kill my migraines or if I have a migraine when I'm not on painkillers, or if it's a combination of the above.
